	I've been working on this project for a couple of days now and it's starting to come along. It started out with
	attempting to create an animation in the terminal. I think the solution is to use the memset() method to reserve
	enough memory. That way frames can be generated prior to display. I have yet to develop any of the front-end, GUI,
	stuff for this project yet, but I am getting started on the back-end stuff currently. Here is a task-list /
	wish-list for features to implement.

	(DONE)	- Ingredients class to better track stock.
	(DONE)	- Items class constructs items to sell from baser Ingredients

		- Add Menu Item methods
		- Create GUI
